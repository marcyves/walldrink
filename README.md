# walldrink

Walldrink is a very simple application initialy devloped to display beverage prices like stocks at the stock exchange.

You can choose the delai between 2 updates from the main window.

BTW, there is only ONE window. No amdinistration(you have to enter the beverage list directly into the database) and the only 2 personalizations allowed are:

 * reset step to 0
 * change delai value

 
Even if this is fully functional, many improvements can be done, feel free to comment, fork and have fun!
